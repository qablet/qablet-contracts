**Qablet Contracts documentation is at [qablet.github.io/qablet-contracts](https://qablet.github.io/qablet-contracts/).**

A Qablet timetable defines a financial product using a sequence of payments, choices and conditions. A valuation model implemented with a Qablet parser can value any contract, as long as the contract can be described using a Qablet Timetable. 

This repository contains code to create qablet timetables.
It does not contain models that price qablet timetables. Such models will be available in other independent projects.
